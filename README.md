Gamedev related

This is a repo that will likely be Urban Terror (Q3UT4, idTech3) based, as a centralized location for code and resources.

The UrT (Urban Terror) community lives and dies based on availability of 3rd-party development for the Frozen Sand developed total conversion modification of Quake3. I represent a part of that community.

Content in this repo is for the community, by the community.

It's easy. The browser environment with GitHub is likely the simplest. For a platform-specific application like GitHub for Windows, clone the repo, open a file in something like notepad, save, commit, sync. Let's focus on the web version for now.

While the mapdev repo remains new, there will undoubtedly be several bumps in the road, or growing pains. Let's see where this goes. I think such a repo can be very beneficial to all developers and gamers in the UrT community. If you aren't familiar with the process of git, I wrote a file [HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md) to get you working with git, fast.

Be sure to check out the [tools](tools) section. I've recently added a carefully designed 2048px levelshot template to [q3ut4](q3ut4) that allows for very high definition levelshot images. The new [vanilla](maps/vanilla) map is a tech demo map for testing stuff. I'll be adding more goodies over time.
