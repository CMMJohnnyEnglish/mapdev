This is a repo that will likely be Urban Terror (Q3UT4, idTech3) based, as a centralized location for code and resources.

The UrT (Urban Terror) community lives and dies based on availability of 3rd-party development for the Frozen Sand developed total conversion modification of Quake3. I represent a part of that community.

Content in this repo is for the community, by the community. I you don't know how to use 'git', install "Github for Windows" (http://windows.github.com), skip the login, and drag the link for mapdev above into the resulting application window to have local access to changing files in this repo. Think of it like explorer, with many checks and balances for multi-user edits (commits).

While the mapdev repo remains new, there will undoubtedly be several bumps in the road, or growing pains. Let's see where this goes. I think such a repo can be very beneficial to all developers and gamers in the UrT community.
