Urban Terror Map Development Repo
=====

In this repo, the focus is mapping for Urban Terror (Q3UT4, idTech3), as a centralized location of code and resources that (initially) I've designed and built. I hope others will follow.

The UrT (Urban Terror) community lives and dies based on availability of 3rd-party development for the Frozen Sand developed total conversion modification of Quake3. I represent a part of that community.

Content in this repo is for the community, by the community.

It's easy, took me a day to get this whole thing together. The browser environment at GitHub is likely the simplest way to make quick updates. With a platform-specific application like GitHub for Windows, or even CLI git via *nix, you can clone this repo, open a file in something like notepad/vi/pico, save, commit, sync.

While the mapdev repo remains new, there will undoubtedly be several bumps in the road, or growing pains. Let's see where this goes. I think such a repo can be very beneficial to all developers and gamers in the UrT community. If you aren't familiar with the process of git, I wrote a file [HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md) to get you working with git, fast.

Be sure to check out the [tools](tools) section. I've recently added a carefully designed 2048px levelshot template to [q3ut4](q3ut4) that allows for very high definition levelshot images. The new [vanilla](maps/vanilla) map is a tech demo map for testing stuff. I'll be adding more goodies over time.
