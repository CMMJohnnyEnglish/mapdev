These are tools for UrT 4.2 level designers.

Except for the versioneer, the bulk of the scripts lived in my maps/ folder. Some are for troubleshooting, others for setting up and configuring or building the map environment. Some scripts could definitely use more documentation, though those were likely used for a special situation.  

Two types of scripts here: windows batch file, and perl for windows. The .bat files should be self-explanatory in their functions. The perl scripts are more tricky. Feel free to clean these up!  

The jewel of the bunch is the versioneer. Alone, it can clone a map in development and construct an entirely new, independent map. Absolutely great for progressing a map version, like ut4_thismap_beta3a to ut4_thismap_beta3b with both maps totally seperate so that there are no unexpected resource conflicts.
