This is a repo for the map ut4_darkwater.

A branch has been created that eliminates unused map resources, called ```darkwater2_alpha```. The purpose of this was primarily to test branching from master and observing the results. Success!

If you branch darkwater2_alpha, you could go forth with your own darkwater-based map. I'd be interested to see if there are any other UrT mappers out there that can harness git to create a community-developed map.
